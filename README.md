# Virtual Reality Painting

Welcome to the VR Painting, a Unity-based project designed to offer a playful yet functional application where users can express their creativity through virtual painting and share their artworks with the outside world. This project allows users to draw and paint using various virtual tools and showcase their work in an accessible web-based art gallery.

## Features

- **Drawing Tools**: Use a variety of tools like spray cans, paint rollers, and paint guns to create your art.
- **Web-based Virtual Art Gallery**: Share your virtual designs and artworks through a web-based gallery that can be accessed on desktop browsers and XR devices.

## Future Ideas

- **Voice-Based Tool Selection**: Implement voice commands to select painting tools and access features like the color wheel.
- **Art Showcase Integration**: Enable users to showcase their designs in virtual galleries. A 'showcase' button will provide a list of active galleries and available slots for artwork display.
- **Location-Based AR Art Showcase**: Transition from a web-based gallery to a location-based AR showcase using Niantic Lightship VPS for a more immersive experience. Users will be able to display their art in real-world locations selected from a list of pre-scanned or custom-scanned sites.

## Tech Stack

- **Unity**: Leveraging XR Interaction Toolkit and support for Oculus 2 Pro to create immersive VR experiences.
- **Web**: Utilizing ThreeJS for 3D web graphics, NodeJS for backend operations, and React for frontend development.
